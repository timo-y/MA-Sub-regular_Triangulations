# Sub-regular Triangulations

Files used for my master's thesis with the title "__Sub-regular Triangulations__". Written at mathematical faculty of the Berlin Institute of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Michael Joswig (http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~joswig/) with the kind help of Dr. Lars Kaster (http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kastner/).

### Files
The repository contains the following files:
- __Abschlussarbeit_340985.pdf__:
*The thesis.*
- __Timo_MA_polymake.script__:
*The documented script for polymake<sup>1</sup> containing all functions that I used for this thesis.*
- __triangulations/__
*The triangulations calculated with mptopcom<sup>2</sup>.*
   - __i4_triangulations.txt__:
 *The triangulations of I^4.*
   - __l44_triangulations.txt__:
 *The triangulations of the 4x4-lattice.*
- __neighborhood/__
*These files contain the data of the neighborhood of the triangulations of I^4*
  - __i4-all_neighborhoods.csv__:
 *Table containing the information of the neighborhood of all triangulations of I^4 shown in Section 4.2.*
  - __i4-counterexamles_neighborhoods.csv__:
 *Table containing the information of the neighborhood of those triangulations of I^4 being the counterexamples mentioned in Section 3.3.2.*
